        My name is Elkhai pronounced (el-kai) and im currently a programming
        student attending Fanshawe College. Since a young age I was always
        intrigued and interested in technology especially the software aspact of
        it and how it actully worked. Fast forward to 2024 and I now understand
        how those softwares, websites, and applications are created! What
        excites me most about being a programmer is the problem-solving aspect
        of it due to the accomplishment you feel when the problem is solved.
